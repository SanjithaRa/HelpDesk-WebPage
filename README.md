# 📚 OOP Module Project - Year 2 Semester 1 🚀

Welcome to the **OOP Module Project** for **Year 2, Semester 1**! This project demonstrates the power of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in both **frontend** and **backend** development. The project serves as a practical application of OOP concepts to build a full-stack application that can be used for various purposes. 🌍

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This project leverages **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts to create a cohesive full-stack application. It showcases **frontend** design principles and **backend** logic while incorporating **classes**, **objects**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **encapsulation**, and **abstraction**. 💻

### ✨ Features

#### Frontend 🎨:
- Interactive user interface designed with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- **Responsive design** for seamless experience across devices.
- **Dynamic content rendering** for real-time updates and interaction.

#### Backend ⚙️:
- Server-side logic built using **Java** and OOP principles.
- Data management through **classes**, **methods**, and **objects**.
- Integration of **OOP concepts** like **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **encapsulation** for efficient backend operations.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - 🖥️ **HTML** for structure
  - 🎨 **CSS** for styling
  - ⚡ **JavaScript** for interactivity

- **Backend**:
  - ☕ **Java** for server-side development
  - 💡 Object-Oriented Programming concepts (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.)

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

1. **Frontend**:
   - Open the project directory in your **browser** to explore the UI and interact with the features.
   - Test dynamic content rendering and responsive layouts.

2. **Backend**:
   - The **backend** handles all data processing and user requests.
   - The application responds to frontend requests using OOP techniques.
